    	<p class="p">Words fall short to express our deep sense of gratitude towards them all who have
                    imparted their valuable time, energy and intellect towards the beautification of our
                    Analysis project entitled as, “Covid-19 Analysis”.</p>
         <p class="p">It gives us a great pleasure in presenting this project. 
         	Its justification will never sound good if we do not express our vote of thanks to our <b><mark>DGT, IBM and EDUNET FOUNDATION</mark></b>
            without whose help our Analysis would have neither began nicely nor
            would have reached a fine ending.</p>

        <p class="p">Never can we forget the hard labor & pain taken by our MENTORS <b>Mr.VAMSI GONELLA  from IBM</b> and <b>Mr.SUKHVINDER  from EDUNET</b>
           who’s hard – working nature, sophisticated teaching & guidance helped us framing
           & building this project & lastly we are also thankful to www.who.org and
           their Research Team for being directly or indirectly helpful to us to build our project
           to be presented to the college.
